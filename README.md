# üçï Pizza Sales Analysis

## Overview
* In this exciting Pizza Sales Analysis project, we dive into the world of data, Python and Power Bi to uncover valuable insights from Pizza Sales Data.
* In this project we use Python's powerful libraries and techniques to process, clean and visualize Pizza Sales data and we will create a Power BI report using Power BI.
* By the end of the project, we will have a comprehensive understanding of data analysis and how it can be applied to derive meaningful informations from the data.

## Installation
* The entire Code is written in Python 3.11.0 using Anaconda and jupyter notebook and the dashboard is created by using Power BI Desktop.
**Requirements**
* Anaconda
* Jupyter notebook of version 6.5.4
* Python 3.11.0
* Power BI Desktop Version: 2.124.1554.0 64-bit (December, 2023) or higher.

**Ensuring you have the latest version of conda.** 
* To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository.

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```


## Key highlights of the project include:

**Data :** The dataset is given in this repository

**Data Preprocessing:** Discover the significance of data preprocessing and cleansing to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis. We'll cover the techniques like converting datatypes, replacing the values in the column, generating day and month name from the date column etc...

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We'll create insightful visualizations to gain a better understanding of the dataset.
Here we use plotly library for data visualization.

**Creating Dashboard:** We'll create the end dashboard by using Power BI Desktop and we'll publish the dashboard to the Power BI Service where we can share it in online for anyone.

**The entire visualizations are done using plotly library.But github doesn't support dynamic visualizations.
